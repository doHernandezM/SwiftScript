# SwiftScript

### "1 part HyperCard, 1 part realBasic(rip), and 3 parts Swift."

This code currently just highlights most swift code. However, in the future this will be able to do things based on the compiled text.

I'm thinking that I should be able to use blocks to get things done.

### Requires:
1. Swift 5.2+
2. macOS 10.15+ for Syntext Highlighting
